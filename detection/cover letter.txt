Dear Sir/Madam,

The amount of energy and enthusiasm that is associated with Aidash Systems has always interested me in applying for a position of Business Analyst at your company.
I truly believe that working at your company will be an exciting and enriching experience.

During my internship I have learned valuable skills that appear relevant to the position desired by your company. Some of the skills I have learned are Python,
Data Structure, OOPs, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Excel, Data preprocessing, Machine learning, Deep learning, Tableau, SQL, HTML, CSS. If given a chance, I can prove to be a 
valuable asset with my present skill set.   

I am a good communicator, so I enjoy working in a team and producing results as a part of the team. I also enjoy working independently as and when required of me. 

I would be grateful to have an interview session with you. Please have a look at the resume that I have enclosed with this letter as per your convenience.

Thanking you,
Jaseem Abbas
